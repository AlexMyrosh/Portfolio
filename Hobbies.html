    <p>So, if you are here, you wanna know how am I resting, right?<br>
        Well, I like many activities, like <em>badminton, table tennis, rollerblading, skating,<br>
        riding a bike going to the gym</em> or just <em>running and playing guitar</em> but unfortunately I haven`t enough time for it<br>
        I like meeting with my friends to go somewhere to walk or play in something<br>
        When I was younger, I was doing kayaking and currently I`m still do it but very rarely<br>
        I also like being volunteer. I have already been approximately 20 times<br>
        So, I like not staying at home and constantly move.
        And of course, I like travelling. I wanna visit as many places and countries as I can.<br>
        I already have been in Germany, and the next time I plan to visit Italy, England and USA<br>
        Hope it`ll come true in the near future
    </p>
    <p>Here you can watch some of my activities from the bike day:</p>
